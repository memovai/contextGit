</p>

It gives AI coding agents a traceable memory layer beyond Git ‚Äî auto-capturing **every prompt**, **agent plan**, and **code change** in a separate timeline. Work freely with AI, iterate fast, and keep your Git history clean. When you're ready, cherry-pick what matters for Git commits.

## Features

- üìí **Context-bound memory**: Automatically track user GitDiffs, prompts, and agent plans ‚Äî independent of Git history
- üêû **Vibe debugging**: Isolate faulty context and leverage it across LLMs for 5√ó faster fixing
- ü§ù **Team context sharing**: Real-time alignment with zero friction
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Change reuse**: Reapply past code edits by description to save tokens when iterating on a feature
- üîç **History-driven optimization**: Use past records and failed generations as reference context to boost future outputs

## How It Works

### Core: Git Plumbing Commands

MemoV doesn't reinvent version control ‚Äî it **leverages Git's low-level plumbing commands** to create a separate, parallel timeline:

- **Bare repository** (`.mem/memov.git`): Stores all snapshots independently from your main Git repo
- **Git objects** (blobs, trees, commits): Uses the same proven data structures as Git
- **No working tree pollution**: Changes are committed directly to the bare repo without touching your workspace
- **Full history access**: Jump between any snapshot, diff changes, or cherry-pick edits

This means MemoV is:
- ‚úÖ **Fast** - leverages Git's optimized object storage
- ‚úÖ **Reliable** - built on Git's battle-tested foundation
- ‚úÖ **Space-efficient** - deduplication through content-addressable storage
- ‚úÖ **Completely separate** - zero interference with your Git workflow
- ‚úÖ **Token-efficient** - no need to waste tokens asking agents to write commit messages or run git commands

### MCP Integration: Automatic Context Capture

The MCP server sits between your AI coding agent and MemoV, automatically capturing every interaction:

**1. Agent makes changes** ‚Üí AI edits files in your workspace

**2. MCP `snap()` is called** ‚Üí Automatically triggered after each AI response with:
   - `user_prompt`: What you asked for
   - `agent_plan`: What the AI decided to do (file-by-file summary)
   - `files_changed`: Which files were modified/created

**3. Smart file handling**:
   - **Manual edits detected?** ‚Üí Captured first in a separate commit (marked as "User")
   - **New files?** ‚Üí Tracked via `mem track` (adds to timeline)
   - **Modified tracked files?** ‚Üí Snapshotted via `mem snap` (records diff)

**4. Result**: Every AI interaction becomes a commit with full context ‚Äî prompt + plan + code changes bound together

**Example workflow**:
```
User: "Add error handling to the API"
  ‚Üì
AI changes api/routes.py
  ‚Üì
MCP snap() called automatically
  ‚Üì
Commit created:
  - Prompt: "Add error handling to the API"
  - Plan: ["api/routes.py: Added try-catch wrapper and error logging"]
  - Diff: +15 lines in handle_request()
```

This creates a **traceable memory** where you can always see:
- What you asked for
- What the AI planned to do
- What actually changed in the code

**Why this saves tokens:**

Traditional approach:
```
You: "Add error handling"
Agent: *makes changes*
You: "Now commit these changes with a good message"
Agent: *reads files again, writes commit message, runs git commands*
```
‚ùå Wastes tokens on: re-reading files, generating commit messages, git operations

MemoV approach:
```
You: "Add error handling"
Agent: *makes changes*
MCP: *automatically captures everything*
```
‚úÖ Zero extra tokens - context is captured instantly without agent involvement
