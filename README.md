# MemoV - ContextGit = Prompt + Context + CodeDiff 

**Never worry about forgetting to commit. Never pollute your Git history.**

MemoV gives AI coding agents a traceable memory layer beyond Git — auto-capturing **every prompt**, **agent plan**, and **code change** in a separate timeline. Work freely with AI, iterate fast, and keep your Git history clean. When you're ready, cherry-pick what matters for Git commits.

## Features

- 📒 **Context-bound memory**: Automatically track user prompts, agent plans, and code changes — independent of Git history
- 🐞 **Vibe debugging**: Isolate faulty context and leverage it across LLMs for 5× faster fixing
- 🤝 **Team context sharing**: Real-time alignment with zero friction
- ♻️ **Change reuse**: Reapply past code edits by description to save tokens when iterating on a feature
- 🔍 **History-driven optimization**: Use past records and failed generations as reference context to boost future outputs
