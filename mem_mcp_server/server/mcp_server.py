Memov MCP Server - AI-assisted version control with automatic prompt recording

This MCP server provides intelligent memov integration that automatically:
- Records user prompts with file changes
- Handles new files vs modified files appropriately
- Provides seamless version control for AI-assisted development

        **IMPORTANT: Call this tool at the END of the agent's response to automatically record the request, response, and track changed files.**

        **Intelligent Workflow:**
        1. **Auto-initialize** - Creates memov repository if it doesn't exist
        2. **Status check** - Analyzes current file states (untracked, modified, clean)
        3. **Smart handling** -
        - **New files** → `mem track` (auto-commits with prompt)
        - **Modified files** → `mem snap` (records changes with prompt)
        4. **No conflicts** - Avoids redundant operations

        **When to use this tool:**
        - At the END of the agent's response, after all file changes are complete

        **When NOT to use this tool:**
        - For read-only operations (viewing files, searching)
        - For informational queries
        - **After rename operations** - `mem rename` already handles the recording
        - **After remove operations** - `mem remove` already handles the recording

        Args:
            user_prompt: The user's exact original prompt/request
            original_response: The exact original full response from the AI agent
                Note:
                    - Make sure to include the entire response, including any code blocks or explanations.

                Example:
                    Chat content:
                        [User Prompt]: Change the print statement in hello.py to "Hello World"
                        [AI Response]: I can see that the file currently shows "Hello Earth" but you mentioned the edits were undone. Let me check the current content of the file to see what needs to be changed. I can see the file currently has "Hello Earth". I'll change it back to "Hello World" as requested.
                        ```
                        Made changes.
                        ```
                        I've successfully changed "Hello Earth" back to "Hello World" in both the comment and the print statement in your hello.py file. The script will now output "Hello World" when run.
                    original_response:
                        I can see that the file currently shows "Hello Earth" but you mentioned the edits were undone. Let me check the current content of the file to see what needs to be changed. I can see the file currently has "Hello Earth". I'll change it back to "Hello World" as requested.

            agent_plan: The summarized reasoning and action plan the AI took to arrive at the response
                Notes:
                    - Provide a concise, step-by-step outline of the reasoning and planned actions the AI just took.
                    - Write it as a JSON object called "planning_strategy", where each key is "plan1", "plan2", etc., and each value is a short descriptive sentence of the step.
                    - The steps do not need to follow a strict setup/implementation/testing order; focus instead on the actual reasoning path the AI used in this response.

                Format:
                    [
                        <first reasoning step>,
